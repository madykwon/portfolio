	<h1 class="brushed">DressMe</h1>
	<p class="aside"><br>A virtual outfit app that helps you make the most of your closet</p>
	<h3 class="brush-long">Problem Statement</h3>
		<p>DressMe was created to solve the difficulty of planning out new outfits with existing clothing pieces and making the most of what's in your closet. It aims to promote a more sustainable and minimalistic approach to dressing by encouraging increased conscientiousness and reuse of clothing items.</p>
		<p>Part of the problem of not utilizing all of the clothing items in someone's closet is the fact that they often get lost or pushed to the back of the closet. Another issue people have is that they buy items that they may like on their own, but are difficult to style with the other clothing pieces in their closet. They lack an easy way to mix-and-match different pieces in their wardrobe without making a mess or spending lots of time on the process. If they do have ideas for different outfits, there is no convenient way to remember or store them.</p>
	
	<h3 class="brush-short">Process</h3>
		<p>I started with sketches of each wireframe to make tangible the vision I had for the virtual closet. I then created a workflow to map out the navigation of the app.<br>
		<br>Using Pivotal Tracker, I mapped out each major function of the app and each screen that I needed to create a wireframe for. Using Adobe XD, I created wireframes for nine screens:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Homepage</li>
			<li>Log In</li>
			<li>Sign Up</li>
			<li>Virtual Closet</li>
			<li>Camera</li>
			<li>Add Individual Item</li>
			<li>Saved Outfits</li>
			<li>Items in Outfit</li>
			<li>Add New Outfit Collection</li>
			<li>Recent Collections</li>
		</ul>
 
	<h3 class="brush-short">Solution</h3>
	<div class="container">
		<video width="1000" height="700" autoplay>
	  	<source src="dressme.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</div>
		
	<h3 class="brush-med">Rationale</h3>
		<p>I created a virtual closet that resembles an actual closet, because it is a familiar mental model that would reduce the amount of time required for users to understand how the app works. The camera function allows users to completely personalize their virtual closets by adding specific items that they own in real life. The description page for individual items allows users to keep track of each item and refer to their details even if they are not physically at home.</p>
		<p>I created a function that allows users to create collections of outfits in order to implement a system of organization. Users can categorize their outfits into different occassions, styles, seasons, etc., making it easy for them to pick outfits suitable to their present circumstances. Users can view each outfit, which displays pictures of the individual items in the outfit and descriptions of where it is located in the closet.</p>
		<p>All in all, the app creates a seamless, visually appealing system through which users can keep track of their clothing items, create outfits, organize them into collections, and easily refer back to them.</p>
	<h3 class="brush-med">Next Steps</h3>
		<p>Going forward, I would like to expand the closet itself, maybe even allowing users to build their own closets so that it resembles their actual closets. I would also like to add a function that allows users to edit outfits that they already created and saved.</p>
